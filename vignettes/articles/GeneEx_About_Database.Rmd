The Database tab offers a publicly curated storage of circuit motifs, synthetic circuits, and known biological GRCs from published literature to encourage additional exploration and sharing of their simulations. 
</p>

<p>
Circuits with `TimeSeries` include their time trajectories for specific model parameters, such as the trajectories for limit cycle oscillations in three gene circuits. The database also includes `Stochastic` circuits that have been simulated with non-zero noise levels. For ease of use, the database can be filtered by biological or synthetic GRC’s and has a search feature as well to locate specific circuits by their unique names or by gene names. Users can directly click on the circuits in the database to load it in the “Circuit” tab and plot any corresponding saved data.  The database will be expanded over time and users have the option to upload their circuits with or without a parameter set. *Note of caution:* Circuits and any uploaded data will not available in the database immediately, as they first need to be manually verified to maintain database integrity.
