A crucial aspect for network modeling is to evaluate whether the simulations
capture the essential features of the experimental data or not. This comparison
will help in finetuning the network or parameters. 

In sRACIPE, the function `sracipeHeatmapSimilarity` can compare two 
expression datasets and return a similarity score. One can provide the 
experimental data and simulated data as two datasets. If the clusters for the 
experimental data are not provided, then the data is clustered using 
hierarchical clustering. Then each model in the simulated data is compared with 
each cluster using correlation of expression values.
